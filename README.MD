## API Documentation

### Create User

```http
POST /api/v1/users/signup
{
    "name": "User Name",
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "password": "password123",
    "passwordConfirm": "password123"
}
```

### Login

```http
POST /api/v1/users/login
{
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "password": "password123"
}
```

### Create Event

```http
POST /api/v1/events
{
    "title": "Event Title",
    "description": "Event Description",
    "startDate": "2024-04-25 14:00:00",
    "endDate": "2024-04-25 15:00:00",
    "timeZone": "Asia/Baghdad",
    "status": "confirmed"
}
```

## Authentication Note

All event endpoints require authentication. Include the JWT token in your request headers:

```
Authorization: Bearer your_jwt_token
```

## Error Handling

The API includes comprehensive error handling for various scenarios including:
- Invalid authentication tokens
- Expired tokens
- Missing required fields
- Database errors
- Rate limiting

### Security Considerations

- Passwords are hashed using bcrypt before being stored in the database.
- JWT tokens are used for authentication and are signed with a secret key.
- All sensitive information, such as the database URI, email credentials, and JWT secret, is stored in environment variables.
- Rate limiting is enabled to protect against brute-force and DDoS attacks.
